## FAQ

#### How many product pages are there in total?

There are 5 product pages in total,namely Women's Clothing, Women's Shoes, Women's Accessories, Men's Clothing, and Men's Shoes, each with their own unique data sets, filters and sort functions. 

#### How does User Authentication work in Login?

Whenever, a new user enters their email and password on the Signup page, it is stored in the local storage. Therefore, whenever someone tries to login, the function in the login page verifies the entered email and password with the stored emails and their corresponding passwords and returns true or false. If the credentials exist in the local storage, the user will be able to login, otherwise the webpage will throw an alert of wrong email or password.
